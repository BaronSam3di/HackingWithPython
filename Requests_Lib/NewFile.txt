Provide a general summary of the issue in the title above -->\r\nMy application is sending data to NLB(AWS network load balancer) , for NLB once the client creates the connection the connection is set to one specific target and it will stay connected for whole life cycle, in case if the target dies the client keeps sending data to target. Target returns RST to client and then client retries the connection.\r\nWhen the target  sednds RST to client , client (doOnDisconnected) method adds the new connection. This whole process takes time and during this time there are packet drops.\r\n\r\nHave created the issue for micormeter statsd, please refer it to understand the problem -> https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/issues/2788\r\n\r\nThere is a property/method made available for client to to retry/re create new connection based on the either scheduler or on certain time duration, then client can re create new connection and not rely on the previously created connection. That way clients do not have work on reactive mode. Which helps in solving the above mentioned problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- /!\\ Make sure to follow the Contribution Guidelines and notably for security

[Gitter](https://gitter.im/reactor/reactor-netty) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reactor-netty). -->\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nExpose the property/method to retry the connection and make sure the switching connection is not dropping any of the packets/no data loss\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\nCurrently the new connection can  only be established when target returns RST and then by calling doOnDisconnect method , this is reactive approach and causes the packet loss. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nCreate a simple app, send TCP data from this app to NLB\r\nCreate NLB , add two targets, \r\nTake out one target from the NLB ,\r\n\r\nExpectation:\r\nAfter taking out one target from NLB, The remaining one should start reeving the traffic immediately \r\nActual:\r\npackets are still sent to removed target, as client is NOT creating new connection or trying to create new connection.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void repoCase()

#592 \r\n\r\nAdds an inversion mutation. See #592. Basically, select two points and reverse the order between the points. It's handy for when adjacency is really important as it ends up being less destructive (if that's what you're looking for). \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- It is possible that the indices are the same or adjacent. This scenario is ignored and results in an unmodified individual\r\n- The function was tested locally, but there are no unit test provided. I am not seeing any unit tests for any other genetic operators \r\n- The `end_point` is **not** selected with `random.randrange(start_index, size)` as that provides a different distribution of selected indices, which is bad. \r\n- I originally wrote the swapping with slicing, but thought it was too ugly.

Its missing mutation probability logic, which seems to be standard with other mutations i.e. :param indpb: Independent probability for each attribute to be mutated.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure this is relevant here. The `indpb` is used in the other mutations where, _if_ mutation is occurring, then there is also a probability that each individual attribute/value/gene will be affected. Here, in `mutInversion`, there is only a need to randomly select two points for the inversion. [See two point crossover as an example](https://github.com/DEAP/deap/blob/f4b77759897d0322ab5a6551106b28f6f4401a4e/deap/tools/crossover.py#L37).\r\n\r\n> 2. Function ’mutInversion’ is missing from `__all__` one line 248\r\n\r\n:+1: \r\n\r\n> 3. The while loop could potentially be replaced by slice and reverse\r\n\r\nI originally did it this way with slicing, but opted for the loop as I felt it was \r\n(a) more self explanatory \r\n(b) less overly python-ie which helps with (i) point _a_ above, (ii) more similar to other languages, and (iii) programmers from other languages would be able to understand it, which is great since this is a popular evolutionary computation framework, and people wanting to use it may not be overly familiar with Python. That said, I do realize I did `individual[start_index], individual[end_index] = individual[end_index], individual[start_index]`, which is perhaps python-ie too, but I felt it was less unclear. \r\n(c) I think I hit a funny edge case with the slicing and was too lazy to address it, so the loop was fine. \r\n\r\nAll that said, if the repo owner prefers the slicing strategy, which I see is used in other genetic operators, I would gladly change it.
